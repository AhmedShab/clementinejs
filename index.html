    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p> Clementine.js started as a personal project to create a boilerplate that would help me easily stand up
        a new project using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js & Node.js). As a novice, I found
        that other boilerplates were often too feature-rich and contained a lot of moving pieces that were difficult
        to untangle.
    </p>
    <p> The purpose of Clementine.js is to provide a lightweight boilerplate for projects where the developer
        wishes to perform most of the integration himself without having to remove many (or any) features.
    </p>
    <p> Currently, Clementine.js is relatively simple and lacks a few essential features: linting & tests to name
        a few. However, I believe that it can be a great start for many beginner-level projects. Over the course
        of the next several months, Clementine.js will evolve to include the missing features and offer a rich, 
        but lightweight boilerplate for MEAN stack projects.
