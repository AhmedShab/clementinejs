					Clementine.js started as a personal project to create a boilerplate that would help me easily stand up a new project using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js & Node.js). As a novice, I found that other boilerplates were often too feature-rich and contained a lot of moving pieces that were difficult to untangle. Additionally, I wanted to ensure that each piece of the application was well-documented and easy to grasp for new developers.
					
					<br />

					The purpose of Clementine.js is to provide a lightweight boilerplate for projects where the developer wishes to perform most of the integration him or herself without having to remove many (or any) features. 
					
					<br />

					Over the next few months, Clementine.js will evolve to include new features and offer a rich, but lightwweight boilerplate for MEAN stack projects.
