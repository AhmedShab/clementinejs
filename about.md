# About

Clementine.js is an open-source boilerplate for full stack JavaScript development originally created by [Blake Johnston](http://twitter.com/johnstonbl01) in 2015. There are many other JavaScript boilerplates, but often they are very large and complex. As a novice programmer, these are sometimes difficult to untangle and while learning how to code.

The primary reason Clementine.js was created was to provide a small and simple option as an alternative to these other boilerplates. This offers an option for beginners to see how pieces fit together in a simple manner, and provides a simpler starting point for other developers. The default (standard) version of the Clementine.js boilerplate comes in at around 4.1 MB with all dependencies installed (excluding database size).

Another advantage of the project is that it is designed without any bias toward a front-end framework or other tools. With the rapidly changing landscape that is JavaScript frameworks and libraries, it's difficult to keep pace with the latest trends. In the case of Clementine.js, that decision is left up to the developer.

Clementine.js is built using Node.js, MongoDB and Express.

# Philosophy

The code:

- Is simple and easy to read
- Follows best practices as much as possible
- Is well-documented

The project:

- Errs on the side of transparency
- Greatly values documentation and clear communication
- Believes in retaining a small footprint
- Is beginner-friendly and approachable
- Is framework agnostic

# Design

The design of this site was heavily inspired by the docs for [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). It's a great tool that I use myself and highly recommend.
