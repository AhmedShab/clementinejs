# Clementine.js MEAN Boilerplate

**Note**: Clementine.js is currently undergoing significant changes. As such, over the course of the next few weeks many aspects of both the application and the related repos (i.e. bare, beginner, fcc, etc) will change. If you experience any issues during this time, please reach out to me via Twitter (@johnstonbl01). 

## Overview

Clementine.js is a lightweight MEAN stack boilerplate intended for beginners and advanced users alike. The Standard boilerplate includes a few more bells and whistles to improve workflow, but remains a simple boilerplate without much fluff to get in the way. 

This version of the boilerplate contains a website that demonstrates the power of the stack, including some examples of how to apply Angular & data-binding using MEAN.
