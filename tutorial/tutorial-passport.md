# Clementine.js Beginner Tutorial - Passport Integration

## Contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have a working version of the application built in the [previous tutorial](tutorial.html).

## Attack of the Auth

Let's assume that we only want people to see our coveted click-counting application who have registered on the site using their Twitter handle. After all, the app is super secret and anonymous users aren't allowed!

In order to accomplish this, we'll need to integrate some sort of authorization and authentication system into our application. Additionally, we'll want to give users the option to sign up for the site if they haven't already. It's important to understand that although authorization and authentication sound similar, they have very different meanings:

- _authorization_ is the set of rules put in place that determine what a user can do within the application based on his or her credentials (i.e. an admin often has more functionality at her fingertips than a normal user)
- _authentication_ is the act of identifying and verifying users (i.e. username / password verfication, etc)

Normally, this requires worrying about securing and encrypting passwords, but luckily we're going to use a very common JavaScript library named [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/). As an extension of this library, we're going to focus on a feature known as [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).

OAuth is an open standard for authentication that allows 3rd-party sites (like ours) to use Twitter (Microsoft, Google and Facebook are also included) credentials to log into the 3rd party site. This is great because we don't have to worry about securely storing the passwords or managing any of the encryption.

This advanced tutorial, created specifically for [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) students, will walk you through integrating this library with the Clementine.js demo application created during [part 1 of the tutorial](/tutorial-beginner.md).

## Setup

### Install NPM Packages

Before we get started in earnest, let's install some of the packages we'll require throughout the installation.

```bash
$ npm install passport --save
```

Passport is the authentication and authorization library that will be used to validate users.

```bash
$ npm install passport-twitter --save
```

This will install the Twitter "Strategy" for Passport. Strategies are Passport's term for different methods of authentication. As an example, there's a Facebook Strategy and a Google Strategy as well.

```bash
$ npm install express-session --save
```

This package is [middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) for the Express framework. You can think of middleware as an "add-on" or "plugin" that will allow additional functionality within Express. In this case, it's going to allow us to use [sessions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3804209/what-are-sessions-how-do-they-work). 

Sessions are essentially server-side storage where information like a user ID are stored and persist through interaction with a website. This essentially means that the site "remembers" your user ID and that you've been authenticated. In the case of this app, it will allow us to interact with the website without having to constantly re-authenticate.

```bash
$ npm install mongoose --save
```

[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is an object modeling tool for MongoDB. It sits on top of the database and provides additional querying and validaiton support for the database. Most importantly, it allows for the definition of [database schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema). 

Think of a database schema as a set of rules that determine the type of data that can be inserted into the database. As an example, we could set up a schema so that a username in the database will always be a string, and that it is a required field. If someone were to try and insert a number or any other data type, an error would be thrown.

It's extremely common to see Mongoose paired with Passport, and even more common to see Mongoose used in place of the default MongoDB Node.js driver. This, in part is due to the schemas mentioned above, but also due to the enhanced syntax. We'll see some of that a bit later.

```bash
$ npm uninstall mongodb --save
```

This will uninstall the MongoDB Node driver used in the last tutorial, since we'll be using Mongoose in its place.

The `package.json` file should now look like:

```json
{
  "name": "beginner-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.12.4",
    "express-session": "^1.11.3",
    "mongoose": "^4.1.0",
    "passport": "^0.2.2",
    "passport-twitter": "^1.0.3"
  }
}
```

### Updating the Folder Structure

Let's go ahead and modify the folder structure to include some of the new functionality we'll be convering. 

```
+--	Project Folder
	+--	app
	|	\--	config
	|	\--	controllers
	|	\--	factories
	|	\--	models
	|	\--	routes
	|
	+-- public
	|	\--	css
	|	\-- img
```

**Project / Root Folder** - The project directory. This directory contains:

- **app/config** - The directory containing configuration files for Passport.
- **app/factories** - Directory for Angular factories. Factories are used by Angular to retrieve information from the model (i.e. API) and pass it to the controller for manipulation. This is a common Angular convention.
- **app/models** - Directory for database models. In this case, this is where the Mongoose schemas will be defined.

The remainder of the folders are the same.

## Mongoose Integration

Before we begin the integrating Passport and authentication, we need to update the current app to work with Mongoose instead of the MongoDB NodeJS driver. This will require a bit of refactoring in our current code.

### Server.js Cleanup

The first step will be to update the current `server.js` file so that it connects to the database using Mongoose instead of the current MongoDB NodeJS driver.

_server.js_:
```js
'use strict';

var express = require('express'),
	routes = require('./app/routes/index.js'),
	mongoose = require('mongoose');

var app = express();

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/clementinejs');

app.use('/controllers', express.static(process.cwd() + '/app/controllers'));
app.use('/public', express.static(process.cwd() + '/public'));

routes(app);

var port = 3000;
app.listen(port, function () {
	console.log('Node.js listening on port ' + port + '...');
});
```

There are 3 changes to the code:

1. Remove the `mongo = require(...)` statement and replace it by requiring Mongoose instead.
2. Remove the `mongo.connect(...)` wrapping function, including the conditional `if` statement. This gets replaced with a Mongoose connection function.
3. Remove the `db` argument for the routes, as we will no longer need to provide that information since Mongoose will do it for us via the schema. Don't worry if this part doesn't make too much sense, we'll go into more detail once we get to that part.

### Create a Mongoose Model

To start, we need to define a schema for the clicks document in the database. Think back to the previous tutorial. The API looked something like:

```js
[{ 'clicks': 0 }]
```

In terms of a schema, we're going to define the properties within the object and its corresponding data type. In this case, the property is `'clicks'` and the data type is `Number`. Defining this will prevent a `String` data type being passed as a value to the `'clicks'` property.

Begin by creating a new file named `clicks.js` in the `/app/models` directory.

_clicks.js_:
```js
'use strict';

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var Click = new Schema(
	{ clicks: Number },
	{ versionKey: false }
	);

module.exports = mongoose.model('Click', Click);
```

First, Mongoose is included in the file with `require('mongoose');`. Next, we're creating a new Schema object with `mongoose.Schema`. Each Mongoose schema corresponds to a MongoDB collection. In turn, each key in the schema defines and casts its corresponding property in the MongoDB document.

The `Click` object is our Mongoose Schema. Predictably, we're defining the `clicks` property and casting its value as a `Number` type. Mongoose automatically adds a property to every schema called `__v`. This property is used for versioning. In this particular case, we've disabled this using `versionKey: false`.

Finally, we must convert our schema to a Mongoose [model](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html). The model is an object [constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)) that represents documents within the database. 

The `mongoose.model` method accepts two arguments:

- The first is the _singular_ name of the collection in the database. For example, ours is named 'Click' which corresponds to our 'clicks' collection in the database. It's important to note that Mongoose will automatically search for the plural version of this argument in the database.
- The second argument is the name of the schema to be converted to the model. In this case, it's our `Click` schema.

This model is exported with [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports), which is a Node function that exports the function or object for use within another file using the `require` function. This is a common Node pattern.

### Updating the Routes

### Refactor Server-Side Controller


- remove db arg
- remove clicks variable
	- to be replaced by instantiating new Schema?
- refactor click functions to be Mongoose syntax.
- export clickhanlder object


- Refactor Current App to Use Mongoose Models
	- server.js
	- app/controllers/clickhandler.js
	- app/models/clicks.js
	- index.js (remove db args)

- server.js modifications
	- require
	- session secret
	- .initialize
	- .session
	- pass to routes
- model
- routes/index.js
	- add routes for:
		- /login
			- get
			- post
		- /register
			- get
			- post
		- /logout
			- get
		- /profile
			- get
	- logged in function
- views
	- login
	- register
	- logout
- Twitter App Config
	- app.twitter.com
		- include screenshot
		- use 127.0.0.1 as callback
	- config/passport.js
