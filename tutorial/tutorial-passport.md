# Clementine.js Beginner Tutorial - Passport Integration

## Contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have a working version of the application built in the [previous tutorial](tutorial.html).

## Attack of the Auth

Let's assume that we only want people to see our coveted click-counting application who have registered on the site using their Twitter handle. After all, the app is super secret and anonymous users aren't allowed!

In order to accomplish this, we'll need to integrate some sort of authorization and authentication system into our application. Additionally, we'll want to give users the option to sign up for the site if they haven't already. It's important to understand that although authorization and authentication sound similar, they have very different meanings:

- _authorization_ is the set of rules put in place that determine what a user can do within the application based on his or her credentials (i.e. an admin often has more functionality at her fingertips than a normal user)
- _authentication_ is the act of identifying and verifying users (i.e. username / password verfication, etc)

Normally, this requires worrying about securing and encrypting passwords, but luckily we're going to use a very common JavaScript library named [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/). As an extension of this library, we're going to focus on a feature known as [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).

OAuth is an open standard for authentication that allows 3rd-party sites (like ours) to use Twitter (Microsoft, Google and Facebook are also included) credentials to log into the 3rd party site. This is great because we don't have to worry about securely storing the passwords or managing any of the encryption.

This advanced tutorial, created specifically for [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) students, will walk you through integrating this library with the Clementine.js demo application created during [part 1 of the tutorial](/tutorial-beginner.md).

## Setup

### Install NPM Packages

Before we get started in earnest, let's install some of the packages we'll require throughout the installation.

```bash
$ npm install passport --save
```

Passport is the authentication and authorization library that will be used to validate users.

```bash
$ npm install passport-twitter --save
```

This will install the Twitter "Strategy" for Passport. Strategies are Passport's term for different methods of authentication. As an example, there's a Facebook Strategy and a Google Strategy as well.

```bash
$ npm install express-session --save
```

This package is [middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) for the Express framework. You can think of middleware as an "add-on" or "plugin" that will allow additional functionality within Express. In this case, it's going to allow us to use [sessions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3804209/what-are-sessions-how-do-they-work). 

Sessions are essentially server-side storage where information like a user ID are stored and persist through interaction with a website. This essentially means that the site "remembers" your user ID and that you've been authenticated. In the case of this app, it will allow us to interact with the website without having to constantly re-authenticate.

```bash
$ npm install mongoose --save
```

[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is an object modeling tool for MongoDB. It sits on top of the database and provides additional querying and validaiton support for the database. Most importantly, it allows for the definition of [database schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema). 

Think of a database schema as a set of rules that determine the type of data that can be inserted into the database. As an example, we could set up a schema so that a username in the database will always be a string, and that it is a required field. If someone were to try and insert a number or any other data type, an error would be thrown.

It's extremely common to see Mongoose paired with Passport, and even more common to see Mongoose used in place of the default MongoDB Node.js driver. This, in part is due to the schemas mentioned above, but also due to the enhanced syntax. We'll see some of that a bit later.

```bash
$ npm uninstall mongodb --save
```

This will uninstall the MongoDB Node driver used in the last tutorial, since we'll be using Mongoose in its place.

The `package.json` file should now look like:

```json
{
  "name": "beginner-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.12.4",
    "express-session": "^1.11.3",
    "mongoose": "^4.1.0",
    "passport": "^0.2.2",
    "passport-twitter": "^1.0.3"
  }
}
```

### Updating the Folder Structure

Let's go ahead and modify the folder structure to include some of the new functionality we'll be convering. 

```
+--	Project Folder
	+--	app
	|	\--	config
	|	\--	controllers
	|	\--	factories
	|	\--	models
	|	\--	routes
	|
	+-- public
	|	\--	css
	|	\-- img
```

**Project / Root Folder** - The project directory. This directory contains:

- **app/config** - The directory containing configuration files for Passport.
- **app/factories** - Directory for Angular factories. Factories are used by Angular to retrieve information from the model (i.e. API) and pass it to the controller for manipulation. This is a common Angular convention.
- **app/models** - Directory for database models. In this case, this is where the Mongoose schemas will be defined.


- Refactor Current App to Use Mongoose Models
	- server.js
	- app/controllers/clickhandler.js
	- app/models/clicks.js
	- index.js (remove db args)

- server.js modifications
	- require
	- session secret
	- .initialize
	- .session
	- pass to routes
- model
- routes/index.js
	- add routes for:
		- /login
			- get
			- post
		- /register
			- get
			- post
		- /logout
			- get
		- /profile
			- get
	- logged in function
- views
	- login
	- register
	- logout
- Twitter App Config
	- app.twitter.com
		- include screenshot
		- use 127.0.0.1 as callback
	- config/passport.js
