# About Clementine.js

Clementine.js started as a personal project to create a boilerplate that would help me begin a new project using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js & Node.js). As a novice, I found that other boilerplates were often too feature-rich and contained a lot of moving pieces that were difficult to untangle. Additionally, I wanted to ensure that each piece of the application was well-documented and easy to grasp for new developers.

Clementine.js provides a lightweight boilerplate for projects where the developer wishes to perform most of the integration him or herself without having to remove many (or any) features. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why X Library / Framework / Etc?

Clementine.js does include a few frameworks & libraries in an attempt to make the developer's life a bit easier. However, all or some of these can be stripped out easily for a completely custom experience. 

### Why the MEAN stack?

Put simply, because it's the stack I use and prefer for development at the moment. I appreciate that I can query the database, write front-end code and write back-end code all with one language: JavaScript. That makes this stack extremely powerful and flexible. However, feel free to mix and match any of these to fit your taste.

## Why 4 versions?

Originally, there was only going to be the standard version. As development continued, I began to realize that the standard version wouldn't meet everyone's needs. Indeed, for an absolute beginner, even the standard version may be overwhelming. Hence, I split the boilerplate up in an attempt to provide an option for all developers. 

Below is a table showing the features between the three versions.
